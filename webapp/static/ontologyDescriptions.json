Based on description logic, a class inherits all the Relationships (Object Properties) and Datatype Properties (if any) assigned to its superclass. In a few occasions, a class may have more than one superclass and belongs to more than one lineage.  \n<br><br>\n<b>Annotations</b>\n<br><br>\nSpecific information may be available about a class, including Preferred_Name, DEFINITION, Synonym, etc. The following provides more detail on annotation information presented:<br>\nDEFINITION: A human-readable definition is provided for each class in the ontology and the displayed format is Owner|Definition (Source).<br>\nFULL_SYN: Synonym of a class in the ontology with type (PT: preferred term, SY: synonym) and source of this synonym indicated. Synonym|Type of Synonym|Source of Synonym is the format displayed.<br>\nICD-10_Code: Code of International Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, 10th revision.

Class_Name is composed of a string only made of digits, letters, underscores, and hyphens. A Class_Name cannot start with a digit.<br>\nPreferred_Name: A human-friendly and commonly used name in plain English.<br>\nSynonym: Synonym of a class in plain English, including those in plural form or British spelling. In contrast to FULL_SYN, no type nor source of synonym is indicated. Synonym is human-friendly and not OWL-compliant.

Instances of the Document Indexing System have been realised for French, English and Dutch ; (ii) The Consultation System allows users to access the information contained in PDSs previously indexed by the Document Indexing System. The test domain for the project was coronary diseases. The existing prototype shows promising results for information retrieval from natural language PDSs and for automatically encoding PDSs into an existing classification such as ICD-9-CM. A set of components, tools, knowledge bases and methods has also been produced by the project. These include language-independent ontology and models for the domain of coronary diseases; conceptual description of the relevant ICD-9-CM codes.\nThis ontology includes a top-ontology, a top-domain ontology and a domain ontology (Coronay diseases surgery).
