This project includes my scripts to estimate ontology term reuse and overlap across all biomedical ontologies in the BioPOrtal repository. It also contains the web application which allows users to find similar terms and visualize term overlap and reuse dependencies in biomedical ontologies.

This work was presented in part under the paper "Investigating Term Reuse and Overlap in Biomedical Ontologies" at the International Conference on Biomedical Ontology, held at Lisbon, Portugal between 27th-30th July 2015.
